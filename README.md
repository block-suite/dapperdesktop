# Dapper Desktop
Please tell me you aren't still rocking that default desktop wallpaper. You know the ones that came with your computer. That's so sad. Let us help.

#### How does it work
All you need to do is give us a wallpaper file and we'll generate all the other sizes for you as well as create an easy to use download interface. We support the creation of desktop and mobile wallpaper.

#### For best results
Use an image at least 5120x2880 (Desktop) or 1440x2560 (Mobile).

#### I like this, who made it?
This plugin is brought to you by [sorta brilliant](https://sortabrilliant.com/) and [block garden](https://block.garden).
